                            that provides a practical option to the existing

                            access formal education in schools, ALS is an
                            alternate or substitute. ALS includes both the
                            non-formal and informal sources of knowledge and
                            skills.

                            Many Filipinos do not have a chance to attend and
                            finish formal basic education (Grades 1-6 and Year
                            1-4) due to many reasons. Some drop out from schools
                            while some do not have schools in their communities.
                            Since every Filipino has a right to free basic
                            education, the Government establishes ALS to provide
                            all Filipinos the chance to have access to and
                            complete basic education in a mode that fits their

                            One is the Basic Literacy Program and the other is

                            anytime and any place, depending on the convenience
                            and availability of the learners.
